# Mensa-Message

This is a small script that, when executed, retrieves the daily meal from the OpenMensa API and sends it to the user and their contacts in a group chat via Signal using the [Signal-Cli-REST-API](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api). If a critique by Mensa.out.of.10 has already been published on Instagram, the script embeds the rating and attaches the image to the message.
