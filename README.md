# Mensa-Message

This is a little script that, when executed, pulls the daily meal from the OpenMensa-Api and sends it to you and your friends in a group chat via Signal by using Signal-Cli-Rest-Api. 
If there's already a critique by mensa.out.of.10 on Instagram, it embedds the rating and attaches the image to the message.
